.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 7zopen
\fI\,OPTION\/\fR

.B 7zopen
[\fI\,PROG\/\fR] \fI\,PATH\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
7zopen decrypts specified 7z archive to volatile memory (RAM)
and opens the files using systems default viewer/editor (or as
manually specified by user). After the viewer/editor program has been
closed, 7zopen updates any files in the 7z archive that were modified.
.PP
Note: This utility only makes sense to use when operating on 7z
archives with single file, or multiple files of same filetype (thus
the same editor/viewer can be used).
.PP
7zopen may be user\-configured to utilize a specific program for
a certain filetype. The configuration file shall be stored in
$HOME/.7zetoolsrc and can specify a program for each mime\-type. For
example in order to use nano for all files with mime\-type text/plain
add a line:
.IP
TEXTPLAINPROG=nano
.PP
You may use 7zopen to determine mime\-type in a 7z archive, as it
outputs this information in the console upon opening the archive.
